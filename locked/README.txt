This folder stores time-stamped snapshots of the site.
- Files here are read-only backups of the repo at the moment of capture.
- Snapshots are generated with `git archive` so they match exactly whatâ€™s committed.
- If GitHub Pages is enabled from root, these archives are public if someone knows the URL.
